# A Perspective on Oil Well Conversion for Geothermal District Heating in Mandaree, North Dakota

This site is part of the spring 2021 U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Collegiate Competition by Team Geothermal Vision. Our team consists of graduate students from the University of North Dakota and Reykjavík University, Iceland. 

We chose Mandaree, North Dakota as the site for our geothermal direct use development project. Mandaree is a community on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, home of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

The town is rural with approximately 280 useable structures. To make geothermal direct use work for the sparsely populated community, the source of heat should be as inexpensive as possible. The goal is to deliver hot fluids by pipeline to each structure at a price below that of propane. This heat network of pipes is more commonly known as district heating (DH). Students investigate what it takes to recomplete oil wells, what geologic formations are of interest, how to maximize production of geothermal fluids, the energetics of the surface system, the economic impacts, where the investment dollars come from, and how this meets the desires of the people of Mandaree.

## What is geothermal energy?

Geothermal energy is a natural resource from the heat produced inside the earth. This energy often rises to the surface through water, often pumped for production projects.

## What are the benefits of utilizing geothermal energy?

--*	Geothermal energy is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

--*	Direct use geothermal networks are emissions free and will not add to air pollution.

--*	It is a sustainable renewable natural resource.

--*	Geothermal heating plants have a small surface footprint, which reduces impact on the surrounding environment.

## Why is Mandaree a suitable candidate community for developing a geothermal project?

Mandaree is located near the center of the Williston Basin and Nesson anticline. The heat that contributes to the well-developed oil and gas resource in the region can also be put to use, generating electricity or taken directly by consumers to heat buildings, melt show on roads, and heat greenhouses. 

## What can geothermal energy do for Mandaree?

--*	Increase access to nutrition through the development of geothermal supported greenhouse.

--*	Support economic development by creating local jobs related to project construction and network operation. 

--*	Reduce the community’s carbon footprint and dependency on fossil fuels.

--*	A community owned and operated district heating network will promote energy sovereignty.
