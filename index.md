## A Prospective on Oil Well Conversion for Geothermal District Heating in Mandaree, North Dakota

Beginning in late January of 2021, the University of North Dakota entered the Spring US Department of Energy (DOE) Geothermal Collegiate Competition. Soon afterwards, students from Iceland School of Energy joined in to collaborate on the geothermal exploitation project. Rules from the DOE, hosted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), state that the focus of each investigation should be for direct use purposes. Direct uses include building heating and cooling, various forms of agricultural process heat, industrial heat, among others. 

It was with the advice of UND student Jessica Eagle-Bluestone, that attention was turned towards Mandaree, North Dakota on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Mandaree is the domain of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) Nation. The town is rural with approximately 280 useable structures. To make geothermal direct use work for the sparsely populated community, the source of heat should be as inexpensive as possible. The goal is to deliver hot fluids by pipeline to each structure at a price below the incumbent fuel source. This heat network of pipes is more commonly known as district heating (DH).

In a preliminary site survey by car and through the course of interviews with local stakeholders, it became apparent that Mandaree may be a good candidate for commercial greenhouses, bringing fresh produce and jobs. Adding heat demand density to the DH system would increase the overall economic feasibility. In addition, the community and region relies often on supplemental jobs from the oil and gas industry. Indeed, many wells are drilled around and beneath greater Mandaree. These wells generally extend to the Bakken shale formation at a depth of approximately 3300 meters. Between surface and that depth exist many warm aquifers that may provide adequate production of hot waters to heat the structures and future industry of Mandaree.
